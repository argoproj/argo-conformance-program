# Argo Certification Program Requirements

## Certification is provided for each of the four Argo projects.
* [Argo Workflows](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows)
* [Argo Events](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/)
* [Argo CD](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/)
* [Argo Rollouts](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/)

## For any certification the following is required
* Offering provided by CNCF member company
* Offering provisions, manages, or hosts compliant instances of target project
* Member company maintains X maintainer(s) within the Argo org. See [Maintainers](https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md)
* Confirm through self-testing the offering is compatible with target project version
* Provider will maintain offering with currently supported versions. Argo projects are supported for the latest 2 versions and generally are released quarterly. For example, if a provider certifies on Argo Workflows 3.1 but does not certify on 3.2, when 3.3 is released their certification expires.
* Offering must include the option for accessing the default UI without modifications beyond each project's built-in extensions and customization systems.
* Argo branding must be left intact in default UI when accessed. Branding includes general UI layout, logos, logo positions, color schemes, etc.
